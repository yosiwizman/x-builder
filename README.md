# X Builder

AI-powered full-stack web development in the browser.

> **Based on [Bolt.new](https://github.com/stackblitz/bolt.new)** - the open-source AI web development agent by StackBlitz.

## About

X Builder is a white-label fork of Bolt.new that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser.

### Features

- **Full-Stack in the Browser**: Integrates AI models with an in-browser development environment powered by **StackBlitz's WebContainers**
  - Install and run npm tools and libraries (Vite, Next.js, etc.)
  - Run Node.js servers
  - Interact with third-party APIs
  - Deploy to production from chat

- **AI with Environment Control**: AI models have complete control over the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console

## Tips and Tricks

- **Be specific about your stack**: Mention frameworks/libraries in your initial prompt
- **Use the enhance prompt icon**: Refine your prompt with AI assistance before submitting
- **Scaffold basics first**: Establish the foundation before adding advanced features
- **Batch simple instructions**: Combine multiple simple tasks in one message
